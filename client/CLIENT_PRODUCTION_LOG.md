# Frontend Architecture Overview

This document outlines the process and reasoning behind our frontend implementation for the MERN Task Manager project. Our goal was to create a modular, maintainable React application using Vite and TypeScript, integrated with Bootstrap for styling. Below are the key steps and design decisions we made:

---

## 1. Project Initialization

- **Using Vite:**
  We chose Vite to scaffold our React + TypeScript project due to its fast development server, excellent hot module replacement, and minimal configuration requirements.

- **Directory Structure:**
  The project was initialized inside the `client` folder. Vite provided us with a basic structure including `main.tsx` and `App.tsx`. We then planned to reorganize the code into modular folders for clarity and scalability.

---

## 2. Setting Up the Entry Point

- **`main.tsx`:**
  In this file, we import React, ReactDOM, and Bootstrap's CSS. This ensures that all Bootstrap classes are available globally. We then render our main `<App />` component within the HTML element with id `root`.

- **Why It Matters:**
  Having a clean entry point simplifies the bootstrapping of the application and keeps the global configurations (like CSS imports) centralized.

---

## 3. Modularizing the Application

- **Splitting the App:**
  We refactored the default `App.tsx` to serve as a simple container that loads a dedicated page component. We created a `pages` folder and moved our main UI into a `Home.tsx` file.

- **Benefits:**
  This approach separates layout concerns (handled in `App.tsx`) from view-specific logic (handled in `Home.tsx`), making the app more maintainable and scalable.

---

## 4. Building the Home Page

- **`Home.tsx`:**
  The Home page is the heart of our task manager interface. It manages the state of tasks, filtering options, and error/loading states. Key responsibilities include:

  - Fetching tasks from the backend via API calls.
  - Handling CRUD operations (adding, updating, deleting, toggling tasks).
  - Maintaining state for filters (`all`, `active`, `completed`).
  - Displaying loading messages and error notifications.

- **State Management:**
  We use React hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`) to manage local state and side effects like data fetching.

---

## 5. Component Breakdown

To keep our UI modular, we created several reusable components:

- **TaskInput:**

  - Handles user input for adding new tasks.
  - Uses local state to manage the input field and calls a callback (passed via props) to add tasks.

- **TaskList:**

  - Displays the list of tasks.
  - Instead of directly rendering list items, it delegates the rendering of each task to a separate `TaskItem` component.

- **TaskItem:**

  - Represents an individual task.
  - Provides controls for editing, deleting, toggling completion, and visual feedback (e.g., line-through styling for completed tasks).
  - Manages local edit state (switching between view and edit modes).

- **TaskFilter:**

  - Offers buttons to filter tasks based on their status (all, active, completed).
  - Enhances UX by letting users quickly switch views.

- **Service Layer:**
  - **`taskService.ts`:**
    This file encapsulates all API calls (using Axios) to our backend. It includes functions to fetch, create, update, and delete tasks.
  - **Why This Layer?**
    Abstracting API calls into a service keeps our UI components focused solely on presentation and state management, leading to a cleaner separation of concerns.

---

## 6. Enhancements and UX Considerations

- **Loading States:**
  We added a loading indicator in `Home.tsx` to display a message while tasks are being fetched from the backend.

- **Error Handling:**
  An error state was introduced to capture and display any issues during API interactions. This is presented to the user via a Bootstrap alert.

- **Filtering Logic:**
  By maintaining a filter state, we can dynamically show all tasks, only active tasks, or completed tasks, enhancing the usability of the app.

---

## 7. Final Thoughts

- **Modular Structure:**
  Organizing the code into `pages`, `components`, and `services` folders allows for easier scaling and maintenance.

- **Type Safety:**
  Using TypeScript throughout the app helps catch errors early and enforces consistency across our components and data structures.

- **UI/UX Best Practices:**
  Integrating Bootstrap provides a responsive and visually appealing design with minimal effort, while loading/error states improve user feedback.

This log should serve as a comprehensive guide to the frontend architecture and the rationale behind each decision. The modular approach ensures that even as the app grows, it remains easy to understand and maintain.
